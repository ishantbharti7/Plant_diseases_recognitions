# Plant Disease Recognition System

## Overview
This project is a Plant Disease Recognition System that uses machine learning to identify diseases in plant leaves. The system is built using TensorFlow for the machine learning model and Streamlit for the web interface.

## Features
- **Disease Detection**: Upload an image of a plant leaf to detect potential diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for seamless user experience.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main application file that contains the Streamlit web interface and model prediction logic.
- `Train_plant_disease.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training the plant disease recognition model.
- `Test_Plant_Disease.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for testing the trained model.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishantbharti7/Plant_diseases_recognitions.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL.
3. Use the interface to upload an image and get the disease prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).
